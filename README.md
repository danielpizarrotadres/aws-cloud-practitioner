### Accesing and Using AWS Services
- Nothing to implement here, we just have to sign in into the AWS Services

- ### Different Ways of Accessing AWS
    - [ ] Management Console
        - Easy to access & navigate (Graphical user interface)
        - Perfect for exploring services & features
        - Complex, repeatd or large-scale setups can become cumbersome
        - Perfect tool for getting started on AWS

    - [ ] AWS CLI
        - Command-driven access (It gives us command-drive acces to AWS instead a Graphical user Interace, install CLI from AWS CLI website)
        - Perfect for well-known complex, repeatd or large-scale setups and tasks
        - Prior installation and configuration needed
        - Can simpify complex, repeated or large-scale setups
       
    - [ ] SDKs (Available in many programming lenguages)
        - Programmatic access
        - Infrastructure as code
        - Perfect for automating tasks
        - Can simplify setups and allows for building (automated) tools
        
    - [ ] API Calls
        - Use services via HTTP requests
        - Request configuration can be challenging
        - Typically, we'd go for one other solutions
        
- Behind the scenes the three ways described before send commands, API HTTP requests.
- AWS in the end exposes an API (a server) and we can send requests to the AWS API to make AWS do something
